# Trends in Popular Baby Names
## Lede Project 2

In this project, I explore a [baby name database provided by the Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) to find patterns, inconsistencies, and trends. I'm not sure my method was super statistically sound, but I did find that the most popular names within the database are no longer popular now, and the variety of registered baby names have gone up. I interpret this pattern as having to do with the rise of individualism--parents are opting for uncommon and unique names over common and "classic" names.
